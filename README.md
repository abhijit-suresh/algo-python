# algo-python

A collection of Python scripts organized by algorithmic patterns for coding practice and algorithm study. All solutions are self-contained, use only the Python standard library, and are structured for clarity and modularity.

## Structure
- `Hash Map and Sets/Hash Maps/`: Hash map-based solutions
- `Two Pointers/Inward Traversal/`: Two-pointer pattern solutions
- `resources/`: Reference materials (e.g., CodingPatterns2.pdf)

## Usage
- Run any script directly:
  ```zsh
  python <path-to-script>
  # Example:
  python "Hash Map and Sets/Hash Maps/verify_sudoku_board.py"
  ```
- Format code with:
  ```zsh
  black .
  ```

## Requirements
No external dependencies. All scripts use the Python standard library.

## Contribution
Add new scripts to the appropriate pattern folder. Name files and functions to reflect the problem and pattern.

## Reference
See `resources/CodingPatterns2.pdf` for accepted algorithmic patterns.
